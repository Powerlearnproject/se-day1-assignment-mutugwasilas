Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software products<br>
software engineering enambles the creation of software systems that power various aspects of modern life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. the development of programming languages eg c and fortran<br>
2. the establishment of software engineering as a discipline <br>
3. the emergence of agile development methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. requirements: involves collecting and documenting user needs and system requirements<br>
2.design phase: creating a detailsed design of the software architecture and user interface<br>
3. implementation: involves writing code and building the system according to the design specifications<br>
4. testing: testing the software system to make sure it meets the quality standards and functional requirements<br>
5. deploying: launching the system for users/customers to use it<br>
6. maintenance: involves providing updates,enhancements and ongoing support<br>

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall struggles with implementing changes once the project is underway while agile embraces and integrates changes at any point<br>
waterfall provides a more predictable path with defined phases while agile doesnt have well defined phases<br>

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer: to write code and implement software solutions to a syatem<br>
quality assurance enguneer: to conduct thorough system testing to make sure it meets the user needs and quality requirements as well as functionality requiremeents<br>
project manager: to oversee all the phases of software development from planning to delivering the finished product to users<br>

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE provides programmers with a platform where they can write code, debug errors and test their code an example is vscode, pycharm etc<br>
VCS enables tracking of the changes made on the source code. it also enables developers to collaborate example is git<br>

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. while developers are implementing a software product,  the requirements may change during the development cycle. to overcome this, they should use agile development which integrates changes as they come<br>
2. tight deadlines : before starting, developers should identify the most critical tasks and focus on completing them first. they should also break the tasks to smaller manageable tasks<br>
3. for technical debts, developers can conduct regular code reviews to catch potential issues early and deal with them<br>

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit testing makes sure all the individual components are working correctly<br>
2. integration testing makes sure that different components/modules are interacting smothly and in the expected manner<br>
3. system testing ensures that the whole system is working properly<br>
4. acceptance testing makes sure that the system meets all the user needs 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
involves crafting questions and statements in a clear and concise manner to get the best possible response from ai models

prompt engineering helps to avoid getting vague responses from ai models
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague prompt: how do you do stuff with variables in php
improved: how do you declare and initialize variables in php
