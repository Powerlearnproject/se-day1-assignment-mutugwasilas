# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
this is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and toolsto developand maintain high quality software systems
importance: it enables the creation of software applications and systems that help us in our day to day lives
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. the development of programming languages such as fortran and c
2. the establishment of software engineering as a discipline
3. the rise of agile development methodology
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. requirements phase: it involves gathering and documenting users needs and system requirements
2. design phase: creating software architecture and user interface
3. implementation phase: writing code and building of software acording to design specifications
4. testing: tests ensures that the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements
5. deployment: launching the system so that the users can use the system
6. maintenance: providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall struggles with changes once the project is underway while agile embraces and integrates change at any time
waterfall provides a more predictable path with defined phases, while agile approach doesn't have well defined phases
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. software developer: writing code and implementing the software solution
2. quality assurance engineer: conducts tests to make sure that the system conforms to the quality requirements
3. project manager: oversees the whole software life cycle from requirements phase to delivering the system and maintenance
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDE: they provide comprehensive tools for writing code, debugging and testing the code
2. VCS: they help developers trach changes made to the source code. helps in coordination of work among team members
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. changing requirements: communicate effectively with the users to know all their needs and expectations. use agile development at it accomodates changes that come during the development
2. tight deadline: analyze the code to know the critical tasks and handle them first. also, you can break down the  project into smaller manageable tasks
3. technical debt: regularly analyze the code to identify potential issues and sort them out
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit testing: makes sure all the independent modules are working properly
2. integration testing: ensures that modules are connecting and interacting as expected
3. system testing: this makes sure that the whole system is working properly
4. acceptance testing: this makes sure that the system meets the usersrequirements and needs
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is all about crafting questions in a clear and concise manner to get the best possible response from ai models,
this helps prevent getting vague or confusing answers from the ai model
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: how do you do stuff with variables in php?
clear prompt: how do you declare and initialize variables in php?
